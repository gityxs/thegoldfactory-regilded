	<b>Notice:</b><br>
	- Please add the ingredients <b>in order!</b><br>
	- For the health potion, you can't make it, you must buy it at the shop :p<br>
	- Also, the health potion is treated separately from these potions :D<br>
	- Once you put items in, you can't take them out anymore, so be careful!<br><br>
